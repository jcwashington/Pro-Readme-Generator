# Easy Professional README generator

## Description
  When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions; this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.

  The purpose of this project is to create a easy-to-use command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input. This cuts down on time spend on this part of the project while ensuring that you have all the necessary components of a professional looking README file.

  Main technologies utilized:
  Javascript, [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and npm [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
  Challenges and Future Developement Opportunities:
  At the beginning of this project, I struggled with the Node (and npm) learning curves, but was fortunately able to access lots of documentation and example code. Next steps will include cleaning up code to make it easier for other developers to utilize.

  * Create a `.gitignore` file and include `node_modules/` and `.DS_Store/` so that your `node_modules` directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your `.gitignore` file before installing any npm dependencies.
  * Make sure that your repo includes a `package.json` with the required dependencies. You can create one by running `npm init` when you first set up the project, before installing any dependencies.
  * Install the Inquirer package using
    ```
